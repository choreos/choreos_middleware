Some ideas that must become issues if we find usce cases for them:

* Make FixedCloudProvider deal with several VMs

* Implement the REST operation POST /nodes/{id}/configs
So we can deploy a given configuration in a specific node

* The POST /configs should support receiving a list of configs,
and not only one config 

* NPM must work even if people create and destroy nodes directly in the cloud gateway
e.g..: using our clean_aws script

* The POST /services should support receiving a list of services,
and not just one service
