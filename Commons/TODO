Commons ToDo list

* ChefNodeNameRetriever is actually searching my_chef_name.sh on NPM resources folder

* Concurrent Knife
To avoid failures on "knife node runlist add", the execution of this command is synchronized
However, if we have different virtual machines executing this command, the result will be not safer
There is two possible solutions:
  * Trying to use the REST API, instead knife commands
  * After executing the knife command, check the runlit with "knife node show"
    If the requested recipe is not there, execute the command "runlist add" again

**** DONE ****

* When using the Commons classes in NPM there is no javadoc.
We must install Commons on maven repository with its javadoc. 
mvn clean javadoc:jar source:jar install

* private key argument on bootstrap should be the last argument
