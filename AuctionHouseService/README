First clone choreos_v_v repository:
	git clone https://github.com/choreos/choreos_v-v.git

Then create the choreosvv jar:
	cd choreos_v-v/choreosvv
	mvn install
	
If the build is not successful, try this and then try `mvn install` again:
	cp resources/musicstore.jar ~/.m2/repository/br/usp/ime/choreos/vvws/webservice/1.0-SNAPSHOT/webservice-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 

Finally, as usual:
	mvn eclipse:eclipse
	mvn install
