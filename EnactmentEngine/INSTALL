Written by Leonardo Leite (USP)

== WHAT IS IT? ==

Enactment Engine enables you to deploy web service choreographies in an automated way.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

Before you run Node Pool Manager and Service Deployer, you will need:

Service Deployer and Node Pool Manager properly running.

== CONFIGURING IT ==

Open the folder EnactmentEngine/src/main/resources, and create a enactmentengine.properties file by copying the enactmentengine.properties.template file. The new properties file must be created in the same folder.

Open the just created properties file and edit it as follows:

ENACTMENT_ENGINE_PORT=9102
NODE_POOL_MANAGER_URI=http://localhost:9100/nodepoolmanager
SERVICE_DEPLOYER_URI=http://localhost:9101/servicedeployer

You may change the values according to your Node Pool Manager and Service Deployer configurations.

== COMPILING IT ==

After installing Maven 3, open the terminal at the choreos_middleware folder, and run the build.sh script.

It can take several minutes.

== RUNNING IT ==

After compiling the project, to run the Enactment Engine you have just to run the main method on the org.ow2.choreos.enactmentengine.rest.EnactEngServer class.

You must run the system using Java 6.

This task can be easier accomplished if you import the EnactmentEngine project in the Eclipse IDE. 

After importing the project, open the menu Window>>Preferences>>Java>>Build Path>>Classpath variables, and set the M2_REPO variable pointing to your Maven repository folder, usually the .m2/repository folder within your home folder.

Obs: we have used the OpenJDK JVM and the Eclipse Indigo version.

If you successfully start the Node Pool Manager and the Service Deployer, you must see the following messages on the console:
Enactment Engine has started [http://localhost:9102/enactmentengine/]
