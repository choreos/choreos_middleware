EnactmentEngine TODO list

Performance bottlenecks
-----------------------
* (HIGH) Update only nodes from a specific choreography.
    * Solved to Fixed Machine, but not to AWS:
        WARNING: .No operation matching request path /us-east-1/i-7f6fd004/upgrade is found, HTTP Method : POST, ContentType : */*, Accept : application/xml,.
        I think the problem is the slash in the node id
* (LOW) Replace WSClient (concurrency problems) by javax (as in futuremarket project).

Others
------

* EnactmentEngine tests should start NPMServer and ServiceDeployerServer,
but this step is not working. Now, we have to start the servers before run tests.
The problem is the way like the RecipeBuilder access the resources.

* Add owner attribute to ChorService class.
For each available owner, the enactmentengine.properties must have an 
OWNER.NODE_POOL_MANAGER_URI and an OWNER.SERVICE_DEPLOYER_URI entries.
So, the Enactment Engine will use this entries to deploy a service
if the owner attributed is specified in the chor specification.
If owner is not specfied, the default Service Deployer is used, just as now.

* If two or more services has the same "group" specification,
they must be deployed on the same node.

* Registry should use a database instead a static map.

* Choreography should contain a ChorSpec, and not TO BE a ChorSpec (inherence)

*** DONE ***

* Finish GET /chors/{chorID}/enactment

* Maybe it would be better map the 4 rest operations (in ChorResource) to 4 methods in the EnactmentEngine interface
In this way, the ChorResource class would be more concerned with REST, and know less about the deatils of operation execution

* Model improvement: ChorSpec has ChorServices; Choreography extends ChorSpec and has attributes id and deployed Services.
