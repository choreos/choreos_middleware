EnactmentEngine TODO list

* EnactmentEngine tests should start NPMServer and ServiceDeployerServer,
but this step is not working. Now, we have to start the servers before run tests.
The problem is the way like the RecipeBuilder access the resources.

* Add owner attribute to ChorService class.
For each available owner, the enactmentengine.properties must have an 
OWNER.NODE_POOL_MANAGER_URI and an OWNER.SERVICE_DEPLOYER_URI entries.
So, the Enactment Engine will use this entries to deploy a service
if the owner attributed is specified in the chor specification.
If owner is not specfied, the default Service Deployer is used, just as now.

* If two or more services has the same "group" specification,
they must be deployed on the same node.

* Registry should use a database instead a static map.

* If multiple Choreographies are enacted at the same time, invocations to nodepoolmanager/nodes/upgrade will overlap.
Two possible solutions:
#1 EE controls the right time to make a single invocation
#2 NPM must provide /nodes/{id}/upgrade, so EE can make more selective invocations
But, if a node receive services from different choreographies, the second options is not going to work properly.

* Invoking npm.upgradeNodes upgrades all nodes
It would be better invoke npm.upgradeNode(node) only to the choreography nodes

*** DONE ***

* Finish GET /chors/{chorID}/enactment

* Maybe it would be better map the 4 rest operations (in ChorResource) to 4 methods in the EnactmentEngine interface
In this way, the ChorResource class would be more concerned with REST, and know less about the deatils of operation execution

* Model improvement: ChorSpec has ChorServices; Choreography extends ChorSpec and has attributes id and deployed Services.
