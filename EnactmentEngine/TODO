EnactmentEngine TODO list

* EnactmentEngine tests should start NPMServer and ServiceDeployerServer,
but this step is not working. Now, we have to start the servers before run tests.

* Add owner attribute to ChorService class.
For each available owner, the enactmentengine.properties must have an 
OWNER.NODE_POOL_MANAGER_URI and an OWNER.SERVICE_DEPLOYER_URI entries.
So, the Enactment Engine will use this entries to deploy a service
if the owner attributed is specified in the chor specification.
If owner is not specfied, the default Service Deployer is used, just as now.

* If two or more services has the same "group" specification,
they must be deployed on the same node.

* The REST API
It must be done with ApacheCXF, not with Jersey, due to license issues.

* Registry should use a database instead a static map.
