The \ee\ is also responsible by the deployment of the coordination delegates, that are executed by the EasyESB. To enable this functionality, we have created the EASY\_ESB artifact type, that is a tar.gz package containing a \texttt{config.xml} file with instructions to the bus. Inside the package there may be other resource files necessary to the deployment. This process enables not only the deployment of coordination delegates, but actually any interaction with the EasyESB. 

The Listing~\ref{lst:config_xml} shows a \texttt{config.xml} file that makes the deployment of a coordination delegate. The \texttt{weatherforecastservice.lts} and \texttt{cdweatherforecastservice.wsdl} files, referenced in lines 8 and 9, are provided within the tar.gz package. The use of the ``../../'' in these lines is mandatory. The url \texttt{http://192.168.56.101:8192/weatherforecastservice} provided in line 15, as well the correspondent WSDL indicated in line 15, are references to a service already running and accessible. The \texttt{ServiceNamespace} (line 20) is the \texttt{targetNamespace} defined in the service WSDL. The value of the \texttt{ServiceName} element (line 21) must correspond to the value of the \texttt{name} attribute of the \texttt{service} element in the service WSDL. The value of the \texttt{EndpointName} element (line 22) must correspond to the \texttt{name} of the \texttt{portType} element in the coordination delegate WSDL. The lts file pointed by the \texttt{config.xml} is provided in the Listing~\ref{lst:weather_lts}, and the value of its \texttt{endpoint} attribute must correspond to the \texttt{name} of the \texttt{portType} element in the already-running service WSDL.
