== WHAT IS IT? ==
The platform monitor is the component responsible for gathering low-level data,
such as disk usage, CPU load etc., and forward this information to the Complex
Event Processor component, where it will be further processed to identify
eventual problems. This component is comprised of the Ganglia monitoring system
(a third-party project) and a daemon (ThresholdEvalDaemon) that collects data
from Ganglia and directs it to the Glimpse Complex Event Processor.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
Since this component gathers data from Ganglia and directs it to the Glimpse
CEP, Ganglia has to be installed on the local machine and a running instance of
the Glimpse Complex Event Processor must be accessible. As the
ThresholdEvalDaemon is written in Java, a JRE or JDK environment is necessary.
We tested only with OpenJDK6, but it should work with any Java 6 or later
environment.

Since Ganglia is an external project, its code is not bundled here; it should
be installed separately. It should be noted that, in CHOReOS, the Chef
configuration management system is used (within the
EnactmentEngine/NodePoolManager components); accordingly, we do provide a
cookbook for it that automates this installation. The NodePoolManager may be
configured to always deploy ganglia to the nodes it creates if necessary.

There may be issues with older versions of Ganglia; at least version 3.2.0 is
recommended, and we tested only version 3.3.5. The provided chef cookbook makes
use of an unofficial, temporary repository created to support the project.

== CONFIGURING IT ==
For the ThresholdEvalDaemon to work, you need to define, at least, the
address for the Glimpse CEP on the file src/main/conf/monitoring.properties .
Other parameters may also be tweaked, but the defaults usually suffice. It is
also possible to refine the parameters for what should be considered
"suspicious" by modifying the files in src/main/conf/threshold_specs .
These files currently need to be modified prior to compilation, as they
are bundled into the final packaged jar file.

== COMPILING IT ==
ThresholdEvalDaemon uses Maven 3; after installing maven, "mvn package" should
be enough to create a complete jar with all dependencies.

== RUNNING IT ==
After installing and running Ganglia, the daemon may be run by invoking
"java -jar ChoreosMonitoringService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
on the command line.

== VERIFYING IF IT WORKS ==
A simple test to verify the system is working correctly is to start the
daemon (after Ganglia is already running), artificially induce the load
average on the machine to go above one and check whether the Glimpse
CEP receives a corresponding message (this may take up to a couple of
minutes depending on a few parameters).

A simple way to increase load average is this script (CTRL-C stops it):

----
#!/bin/bash

trap "kill -TERM -$$" INT

over() { while true; do :; done }

( over )&
( over )&
( over )&

wait
