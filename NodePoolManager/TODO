NodePoolManager ToDo list

Code improvements

* Update ChefScripts as in SeviceDeployer, no file reading

* After applying a configuration, use "knife node show NODE" to verify if the recipe was installed with success
If not, return an error

* Pick up already existing nodes in order to reduce middleware testing time
