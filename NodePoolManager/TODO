NodePoolManager ToDo list

Code improvements

* Update ChefScripts as in SeviceDeployer, no file reading

* After applying a configuration, use "knife node show NODE" to verify if the recipe was installed with success
If not, return an error

* Pick up already existing nodes in order to reduce middleware testing time

* To change initial message from "Node Pool Manager is started..."
to "Node Pool Manager has started in http://localhost:9100/nodepoolmanager/"
This applies to ServiceDeployer and StorageFactory as well
