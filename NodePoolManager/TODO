NodePoolManager ToDo list

Code improvements

* After applying a configuration, use "knife node show NODE" to verify if the recipe was installed with success
If not, return an error

* Pick up already existing nodes in order to reduce middleware testing time

* To change initial message from "Node Pool Manager is started..."
to "Node Pool Manager has started in http://localhost:9100/nodepoolmanager/"
This applies to ServiceDeployer and StorageFactory as well

* POST /nodes/configs is returning the node ip on location header
It should return the node id in the location header
and it would be better return the node representation on the body response

* Is indeed useful a REST operation POST /nodes/{id}/configs
So we can deploy a given configuration in a specific node

* The singleton instance management of NodeSelector implementation
should be performed by the implementing classes themselves,
and not by the Factory class.
So, the FactoryClass can just call NodeSelectorImpl.getInstance()

* The POST /configs should support receiving a list of configs,
and not only one config 

* Controller should be singleton

* We were having problems with concurrent calls to EC2 and knife APIs.
Find out why. Although it seems to be server fault, could it be our client's problem?

* Disable third party library log in our log generated by log4j

* Create a Java project Utils to avoid code replication
