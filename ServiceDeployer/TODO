Service Deployer TODO

- Move NodePoolManager client functionality to NPM project, since this client it's used by more than one project
- RecipeDeployer.deployRecipe makes a GET request; it should rely in NodePoolManagerClient to do this!
- But to achieve this, NodePoolManagerClient needs to implement the GET operation

- DeployedServicesRegistry: improvement needed?
Is it possible to interact with chef to store data?
- BUG: GET /services is not working properly
- to Petals services the endpoint-name must be provided,
however it could be parsed from XML
- The CDDeployTest should verify if the given URI really returns a WSDL and not just to check for the 200 status code
- run clean_aws.sh after every test
  must be done also in NodePoolManager and StorageFactory
- Would be better ServiceDeployer tests start and stop NodePoolManager,
  instead developer having to start NodePoolManager manually
  To achieve this, a "project dependence" is necessary
