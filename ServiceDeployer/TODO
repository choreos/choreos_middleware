- Duplication of code:
	- Copied and adapted Recipe, RecipeFactory and RecipeDeployer classes from 
	StorageManager
	- Copied CLIHelper class from StorageManager
- Pending requirements:
	- BPEL deployment
	- Petals JBI consume
	- Petals auto-deployment (node pool manager??)
 	- RegistryFacade is still very simple and should be improved. Is it possible
 	 to interact with chef to store data?

- Move NodePoolManager client functionality to NPM project, since this client it's used by more than one project
- RecipeDeployer.deployRecipe makes a GET request; it should rely in NodePoolManagerClient to do this!
- But to achieve this, NodePoolManagerClient needs to implement the GET operation
- service.port receive the hardcoded 8080 in ServiceDeployer.getServiceURL(). How to improve this?
