- Duplication of code:
	- Copied and adapted Recipe, RecipeFactory and RecipeDeployer classes from 
	StorageManager
	- Copied CLIHelper class from StorageManager
	- Copied NodePoolManagerHandler class from StorageManager
- Pending requirements:
	- BPEL deployment
	- Petals JBI consume
	- Petals auto-deployment (node pool manager??)
 	- RegistryFacade is still very simple and should be improved. Is it possible
 	 to interact with chef to store data?
