These services were made to test the Enactment Engine

The client calls the Buy operation in TravelAngency agency.
So, the TravelAgency service calls the Buy operation in the Airline service.
The flight ticket number is returned from Airline to TravelAgency, 
and from TravelAgency to the client.
The EnactmentEngine must call the setInvactionAddres operation on TravelAgency service 
to define which Airline the TravelAgency will depends on.

The pom files are configured to generate WAR files.
To generate JAR files just change the packaging content (in the pom) to "jar".
The jaxws-rt dependency is not necessary to generate JAR files.
Removing jaxws-rt reduces the package size from 2.7Mb to 6.4kb!
To generate JAR or WAR files, just type "mvn package"
