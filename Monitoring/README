=== MODULES DESCRIPTION ===

== GmondConf ==

GmondConf is a tool for reconfiguring Ganglia in the local machine. It enables users to create, edit and/or remove UDP send channels from the ganglia configuration file in an automated fashion.

It automatically creates the updated configuration and sends a signal for gmond (ganglia's monitor daemon) to load the new configuration without necessarily restarting the monitor process.

To use it one should issue the following command:
java -jar gmondconf [--add host port] [--update-port host port] [--update-host currentHost newHost] [--update-channel currentHost newHost newPort] [--remove host] [--config-file configFile]

As can be seen, all of the parameters are optional. These options are described below:

--add :
	creates a new UDP send channel, with the provided host and port combination.

--update-port :
	updates the UDP send channel for the provided host to use the newly appointed port.

--update-host :
	updates the UDP send channel for the provided currentHost, replacing it with newHost.

--update-channel :
	removes the UDP send channel for the provided currentHost, replacing it with a new one for newHost at the provided port.

--remove :
	removes the UDP send channel for the provided host. 

--config-file :
	indicates the configuration file location. If not provided, "/etc/ganglia/gmond.conf" location is presumed.
